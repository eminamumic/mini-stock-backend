# MiniStock Backend API

This repository contains the backend component of the "MiniStock" application, a robust and scalable solution for inventory management, goods movement tracking, and warehouse organization. It is developed with a focus on modularity, performance, and reliability, using modern technologies and best practices.

## üéØ Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a reliable and highly functional API service that supports complex inventory management operations. This includes:
- Creating and managing entities such as products, warehouses, and suppliers.
- Detailed tracking of goods movements (inbound, outbound, transfers) with references to documents and processes.
- Efficient data searching and filtering to provide users with quick access to information.
- Maintaining data consistency through strict relational integrity and validation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The backend is built on a foundation of modern and efficient technologies:
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications, built on TypeScript.
- **TypeScript**: A programming language that brings static typing, which significantly improves code quality and maintainability.
- **TypeORM**: A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that allows for elegant database interaction, reducing the need for raw SQL queries.
- **MySQL**: A robust relational database that ensures data consistency, integrity, and persistence.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for automatically generating interactive API documentation, facilitating testing and integration.

## üìÇ Project Architecture

The project is organized using a modular architecture, where each key domain (`StockMovement`, `Warehouse`, `Product`, etc.) has its own dedicated module. This structure enables:
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each module has its own `Controller`, `Service`, and `Module`, which isolates business logic and makes the codebase easier to navigate.
- **Simple Maintenance**: Modifications within one domain do not directly affect other parts of the system.
- **Scalability**: It's easier to add new functionalities and entities without compromising the existing structure.

## üìä Schemas (DTOs)

Each entity has defined schemas (DTOs) that ensure a proper data structure for API operations.

- `Create...Dto`: Schema for creating a new record.
- `Update...Dto`: Schema for updating an existing record.
- `Search...Dto`: Schema for sending search criteria.

## üöÄ API Endpoints

All API endpoints are organized by entity and are accessible via standard HTTP methods.
